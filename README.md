# Wine Rating Analysis

This short study compares wine ratings and prices received for various wine production countries and recommends the best and cheapest wine sourcing options.

## Background:

Hotel TULIP (a hypothetical organisation) is a five-star hotel that locates in Deakin University, Australia. It is a very special hotel with an equally special purpose: Not only does it embody all the creative energy and spirit of Deakin University, it’s a “learning environment” on which the tourism and hospitality students are trained for future hoteliers.

Recently, Hotel TULIP would like to review the menu and tempt any guest with delightful wines. The hotel’s CIO, Dr Bear Guts (not Bill Gates!), believes that ratings provided by the WineEnthusiast (a multichannel marketer of a growing line of wine ) are great resources to help their Market Promotion Division to identify potential excellent wine with affordable price. Hence, Hotel TULIP would like to outsource the web usage mining task to Team- SIT742 (a hypothetical data analytics company) to analyze a wine rating dataset and discover taste and price patterns of different types of wine over the world.
